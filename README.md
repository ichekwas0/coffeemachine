# coffeemachine
•	I created the digital version of a coffee machine by writing programs and functions that replicate the functions of a coffee machine which include choosing the type of coffee you want, if the resources are sufficient to produce the required coffee, putting in some money for the coffee, and making the coffee
•	I made a dictionary containing ingredients and price of each drink (espresso, cappuccino, and latte). A dictionary containing the available resources the coffee has was made as well.
•	I depicted functions such as checking if the resource in the machine is sufficient to make the drink that is required. A mechanism to process coins that we give the machine, the machine will process the coins and make sure that the money is greater than or equal to the price of the drink chosen, we get a chance back if the former occurs but if the latter occurs the money is refunded. The money for the drink is added to the machine. Then we make the required drink and subtract the ingredients of the drink from the resources available in the coffee machine. We can get another drink if the resources in the machine are sufficient.
•	I wrote this program with Object Oriented Programming and without Object Oriented Programming.
